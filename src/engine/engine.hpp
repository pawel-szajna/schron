 * @brief The graphical engine.
 *
 * This module contains the graphical engine used by the game.
 *
 * The engine uses SDL3 for its output, however the game world itself is rendered
 * by the software renderer contained in this module.
 *
 * Apart from the main renderer and the lighting calculator, this module also
 * provides the random noise effect generator.
